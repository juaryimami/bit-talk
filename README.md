### **2. Validate Demand Before Building**  
Before coding, confirm:  
âœ” **Will restaurants post videos?**  
   â†’ Pitch 20-30 restaurants in Addis (e.g., **Sishu, Kategna, Limetree**). Offer free video shoots for early adopters.  
âœ” **Will users order this way?**  
   â†’ Run a **fake door test** (e.g., Instagram page with food videos + "Order Now" button to gauge interest).  

---

### **3. Tech Stack Recommendations**  
| Part | Tech Options | Cost-Effective Choice |
|------|-------------|----------------------|
| **Frontend** | React Native, Flutter | Flutter (works for both iOS & Android) |  
| **Backend** | Firebase, Node.js | Firebase (fast setup, real-time DB) |  
| **Video Hosting** | AWS S3, Cloudinary | Cloudinary (optimized for short videos) |  
| **Maps/Location** | Google Maps API | Required for "nearby" feature |  
| **Payments** | teleBirr (Ethiopia), Stripe (Dubai) | Integrate early |  

**Cost Estimate for MVP:** ~$10K-$20K (if outsourced) or $0 if you learn/no-code tools.  

---

### **4. Business Model & Revenue Streams**  
| Revenue Source | How It Works | Potential Earnings |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Commission per order** | 10-15% from restaurants | High (if volume grows) |  
| **Sponsored Videos** | Restaurants pay to boost posts | Medium (early stage) |  
| **Delivery Fees** | Charge users $0.50-$2 per delivery | Low (competitive market) |  
| **Premium Subscriptions** | Restaurants pay for analytics/ads | Later stage |  

---

### **5. Marketing & Launch Strategy**  
#### **Addis Ababa (First Market)**

  - Offer **free video production** for the first 50 sign-ups.  
  - Highlight "Bit Talk Verified" badges for top-rated spots.  
- **User Acquisition:**  
  - TikTok/Telegram ads targeting foodies (cheap in Ethiopia).  
  - "Rate & Win" campaign (users who rate dishes get discounts).  

#### **Dubai (After Validation)**  
- Partner with **cloud kitchens & luxury hotels** (high-margin).  
- Focus on **high-quality video aesthetics** (Dubai users expect premium content).  

---

### **6. Competitor Avoidance Strategy**  
- **In Addis:** No direct competitor yetâ€”move fast.  
- **In Dubai:** Differentiate with:  
  - **Better UI** (TikTok-style > Zomatoâ€™s static images).  
  - **Hyper-local trends** (e.g., "Best Mandi in Deira today").  

---

### **7. Funding Options**  
- **Bootstrapping:** Start with personal savings (MVP first).  
- **Angel Investors:** Pitch Ethiopian/UAE investors (focus on food-tech).  
- **Grants:** Explore Dubai SME or Ethiopian tech grants.  

---

### **Next Immediate Steps**  
1. **Create a Pitch Deck** (1-2 slides: problem, solution, mockup).  
2. **Talk to 10 Restaurants** (Addis) â€“ will they join?  
3. **Build a Landing Page** (use Carrd.co) to collect emails.  
4. **Find a Cofounder/Dev** (if youâ€™re non-technical).  

---

### **Final Thought**  
Your idea is **strong** because:  
âœ” **TikTok + Food Delivery = Untapped in Ethiopia.**  
âœ” **Dubai loves premium food experiences.**  

**Biggest Risk?** Getting restaurants to post consistently. **Solution?** Assign a team member to help them film initially.
